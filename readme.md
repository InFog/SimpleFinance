Simple Finance is an ultra simple finance managent. Just keep track of your
money!

## About this project

This is a personal project, I made it because I do really need to keep track
of my pretty little money. I'm also studing some PHP best practices and
what the cool kids are doing. That's why I'm using Composer for dependency
management, PHPUnit for unit testing, Travis-CI for Continuous Integration
and Coveralls for code coverage. I want this project to be an example of a
good PHP project.

## General usage

Simple Finance is for geeks and nerds, sorry... If you're not, just ask one to
install it for you and teach you how to use it.

## Installation and usage

So you're geek and want to use it? You will need:

  * PHP 5.3 or higher
  * A SQL database (SQLite is fine)
  * A web server (One that suports the whole thing)
  * A web browser (I'm using my smartphone, yeah!)

Install it in your web server, install composer dependencies, configure the
database conection and access from a browser to setup a password. And you're
done.

Enjoy!
