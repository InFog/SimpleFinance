Simple Finance is an ultra simple finance managent. Just keep track of your
money!

## General usage

Simple Finance is for geeks and nerds, sorry... If you're not, just ask one to
install it for you and teach you how to use it.

## Installation and usage

So you're geek and want to use it? You will need:

  * PHP 5.3 or higher
  * A SQL database (SQLite is fine)
  * A web server (One that suports the whole thing)
  * A web browser (I'm using my smartphone, yeah!)

Install it in your web server, install composer dependencies, configure the
database conection and access from a browser to setup a password. And you're
done.

Enjoy!
